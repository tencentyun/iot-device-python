# Device Log Reporting
## Overview
The device log reporting feature can report device logs to the cloud over HTTP and display them in the console for you to remotely debug, diagnose, and monitor the device status. For more information on how to view device logs, please see [Cloud Log](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/14445).

To try out the device log reporting feature, you need to enable **Device Log** and set the corresponding log level in **Device Information** > **Device Log Configuration** in the console.
